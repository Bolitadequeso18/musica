            <p>Packin' all my things for the summer
                Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer, 'cause I
                Didn't call when I got your number
                But I liked you a lot<br>
                Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
                Everybody said you're a killer, but I
                Couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
                The day your record dropped
                The day I saw your white Mustang
                Your white Mustang
                The day I saw your white Mustang
                Your white Mustang
                Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
                I've been actin' like armageddon, 'cause you
                Held me in your arms just a little too tight
                That's what I thought
                Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
                I was such a fool for believin' that you
                Could change all the ways you've been livin'
                But you just couldn't stop
                The day I saw your white Mustang
                Your white Mustang
                The day I saw your white Mustang
                Your white Mustang
                And you're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
                And the sound, it was frightenin'
                And you were gettin' a part of that
                You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
                White Mustang
                Your white Mustang
                The day I saw your white Mustang
                Said you're a wild Mustang
                You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
                You're gonna hit me like lightnin'.</p>
